### Implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm on GeoJSON Graphs for Efficient Shortest Path Calculation

#### Introduction

Djikstraâ€™s algorithm is a path-finding algorithm, like those used in routing and navigation.

We will be using it to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

It fans away from the starting node by visiting the next node of the lowest weight and continues to do so until the next
node of the lowest weight is the end node.
